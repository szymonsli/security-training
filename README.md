# Demo Shop Flask App

This is a simple intentionally vulnerable Flask demo shop. It was generated by AI, so I don't really know the code at the beginning. Let's make it more secure!

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the app:
   python app.py

3. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.
